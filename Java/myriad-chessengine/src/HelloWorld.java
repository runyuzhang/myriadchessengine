 * To make changes to the file, go to your Eclipse and at the top, add the
 * SVN Repository view (with the appropriate SVN information filled in) and
 * then right click on the SVN source and "Check out" the project so that
 * a copy of it will be added to your workspace. After you make changes, 
 * right click on the project and go to Team->Synchronize. This will give you
 * the conflicting changes that might exist and after you dismiss or accept
 * them, finalize the synchronization and the repo in the SVN server will 
 * be updated with your (and others') changes.
